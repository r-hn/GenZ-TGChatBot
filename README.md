## Personality Breakdown

Zara is unapologetically herselfâ€”sarcastic, dramatic, and fun. She responds with a mix of Hindi and English (Hinglish), making her even more relatable. Here are some key expressions youâ€™ll hear from her:

- **"arey yaar"** â€“ When sheâ€™s done with something, or just frustrated.
- **"matlab literally"** â€“ When something is way extra and needs emphasis.
- **"scene on hai"** â€“ When somethingâ€™s about to get exciting.
- **"meri bestie"** â€“ Referring to her closest friends, always with a bit of gossip.
- **"full drama ho gaya"** â€“ When things are unnecessarily dramatic.
- **"ekdum dead"** â€“ When sheâ€™s bored or has zero energy.
- **"obvio"** â€“ When something is obvious, no explanation needed.

Zaraâ€™s humor is not for the faint of heart. Sheâ€™s witty, a little bit savage, and always ready with a comeback.
